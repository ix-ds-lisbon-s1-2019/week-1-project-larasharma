# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.



This is my blog URL: https://larasharma.github.io/

Blog is live and has everything required, poker game executes but has an odd hiccup or two, for example:

```
Numerical number of players: 4
Name: Bob
Name: Brad
Name: Bingo
Name: Brett
The following hands are:  {'Bob': [6, 11, 2, 4, 12], 'Brad': [13, 13, 5, 7, 9], 'Bingo': [2, 7, 8, 12, 13], 'Brett': [10, 12, 8, 10, 14]}

Brad and Brad wins.
```


Well done Lara!
